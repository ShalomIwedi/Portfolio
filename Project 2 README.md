# Project 2

## Description
The project was the development of an As-Built 3D model and plant documentation for a gas and condensate field undergoing an expansion project. I assembled and led a team of four designers to execute this project to completion.

Using AVEVA E3D, we modeled pipes, mechanical equipment, structural components, civil elements, cable trays, instruments, and electrical systems, ensuring alignment with the scanned cloud data of the facility. Once the 3D model was completed, several 2D layout drawings were extracted and drafted using AutoCAD.

Key deliverables included the comprehensive 3D model and extracted 2D drawings such as the general plot plan, piping general arrangement drawings, equipment layout drawings, safety layout drawings, and piping isometrics.
