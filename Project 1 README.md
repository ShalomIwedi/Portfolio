# Project 1

## Description
The project was the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) of an oil field development project and its objective was to maximize the commercial potential of the oil field by developing 0.814 Tscf of gas, 24 million barrels of condensate, and 48 million barrels of oil (P50 recovery base case).

My primary responsibility was to develop a 3D model for one of the project locationsâ€”a modified onshore flow station using AVEVA E3D software. The project was executed in two phases. The first phase involved As-Built modeling of the existing facility, where I generated a 3D model of the current flow station from scanned cloud data to assess available space for the new station. The second phase focused on creating a 3D model based on FEED documents, including Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), Equipment General Arrangement drawings, structural drawings, safety equipment drawings, and civil engineering drawings.

I assembled and led a team of three to execute this project. My role included modeling pipes, equipment, electrical and instrument trenches, and safety equipment, while the other team members were responsible for structural and civil elements. Key deliverables included the 3D model and 2D extracted drawings such as the general plot plan, piping general arrangement drawings, Equipment layout drawing, safety layout drawings, escape route layout and piping isometrics.
